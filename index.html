    <h2>The story</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
            around to commiserate. They said,<q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This
                is most
                unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q> The next day the horse came back
            bringing seven wild horses with it,
            and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great
                turn of events. You now
                have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q></p>
        <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
            leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span></q>, and
            the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q> The next day the
            conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he
            had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</q>
            Again, he said,
            <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q></p>
        <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
            tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> —
            because you never know what will be the
            consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span
                    class="good">good</span> fortune.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are
                <span
                        class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for
                bananas.
                Let's
                not make a big deal out of it...</p>
